# Direct methods

Two applications for solving the squared Poisson equation using direct numerical methods and one for constructing polynomials of successive degrees that give the best mean square approximation of functions of one variable. The resulting solutions are used to plot graphs

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

- Gnuplot

## Launching the application in each directory(direct_methods or iterative_methods or polynom)

```bash
make
./main
```
